This repository contains the codebase for leveraging Large Language Model (LLM) Agents to assist in decision-making for power system operations. It includes Jupyter Notebook and MATLAB scripts for various tasks related to power system balance.

## Repository Structure

- `Prob Generator.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook utilizing Microsoft's Autogen framework for probabilistic generation and system operation tasks.
- MATLAB Codes: Scripts that rely on optimization libraries for power system modeling and decision-making.

## Updates on 30th March 2025

A new 10-trial experiment has been implemented to evaluate the performance of the LLM-assisted Stochastic Unit Commitment (LLM-SUC) framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the LLM-SUC approach achieves a cost reduction of approximately 1.1â€“2.7% and lowers load curtailment by around 26.3% compared to the traditional SUC method.

The probability generation code is now all in the 'Prob_MoreTest.py' file.

## Getting Started

### Setting Up the Environment for `Prob Generator.ipynb`

To run the `Prob Generator.ipynb`, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Conda Environment**:
   ```bash
   conda create -n autogen-env python=3.10
   ```

2. **Install the `autogen-agentchat` Package**:
   ```bash
   pip install autogen-agentchat~=0.2
   ```

3. **Create a Jupyter Notebook Kernel**:
   ```bash
   ipython kernel install --user --name=Autogen-kernel
   ```

4. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Open the `Prob Generator.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Ensure you select the `Autogen-kernel` before running the notebook.
